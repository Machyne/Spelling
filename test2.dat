 AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet.
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.
when you go scrumping you have got to be carefulXXXcarefull you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples.
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears.
when you go pinching applesXXXapple you do not want to take tooXXXto many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you especiallyXXXaspecally little boys they make too much noise.
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be carefulXXXcarful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump whereverXXXwhereever it stings you.
when you are by yourself and someoneXXXsomeone comes and you have to climb over the barbedXXXbarb wire and get caught the man will probablyXXXprobally catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you.
some people when theyXXXthe catch you they might hit you and sayXXXsaid he will hit you harder next time he catches you.
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat.
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses.
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard.
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be recognizedXXXreconnised very easy because red shows up very easy.
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.

 The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make anotherXXXanother savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze.
he's gone to collect his meal.
He makes a leap.
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal.

 WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about.
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song.
The leaves have gone.
It will not be long before the tree has gone.

 StrandedXXXStranden on a Desert Island
One midsummerXXXmidsummer's day at 9.30 a.m.
a ship was wrecked by a coralXXXcorral reef so people jumped overboard.
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on.
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore.
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfitsXXXoutfits .
So one man volunteeredXXXvolonteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room.
ThereXXXTheir were dead bodiesXXXbodys on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreckXXXshipwreck .
ThereXXXTheir were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island.
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room.
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water.
As he openedXXXopen the store room door the water gushed in very quickly.
So he had to feel for the diving suits.
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5.
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent twoXXXto men to help him.
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on thenXXXthe went down to get some food.
LuckyXXXLuckily enough it was mostly tinnedXXXtin food.
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island.
When looking around the deck they saw a lifeboatXXXlifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in.
They all had one tin of something each.
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough.
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts.
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day.
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested.
There was about 35 on the island but people who usedXXXuse't to get coconuts usuallyXXXusally got lost or got bitten by a snake.
They had shortenedXXXshortend downXXXdone from 35 to 15.
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to.
And they could also catch fish to eat.
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they killedXXXkill animals and drank fresh water from springs.
they found here and there.
they found coconuts while hunting for animals.
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside.
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the groundXXXgound and sticks laidXXXlaide across with grass on top of them.
At night they slept all together under coconut trees.
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning.
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again.
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted.
As soon asXXXass they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office.
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since.
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again.

I said shut your gob and I took two apples out of my bag and through them at him, one hit him in the guts and hit him on the bonce, he fell toXXXtoo the ground and lay there, and I said to myselfXXXmyself that'sXXXthats a good Job now I can eat my apples.

 LEAVING SCHOOL
When I leaveXXXleav school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's at Mording.
I work up there at weekendsXXXweekend and in the holidays.
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people.
They have a farm attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a meadow.
They have a tractor and a trailer.
ThereXXXThey are two brothers Frank and John.
John is my boss.
Frank has four cars two which go and two which do not go.
John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one heiferXXXeffer .

 THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs out with John, then the lorry.
Then we go back down the yard and unload the dung.
Then I started the tractor up againXXXagain , and went out on toXXXtoo the fieldXXXfild .

But we soon got out of thatXXXtheat when John put some bricks under the wheels This is the tractor whichXXXwitch I drive at weekendsXXXweekends , and in the holidays.
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to T.V.O.
Then away you go.
It is a low gearedXXXgird tractor it has three forwardXXXfowd gearsXXXgirse and 1 reverseXXXreveirse .
It has fourXXXfor cylindersXXXsilinders and a hydraulicXXXhighdrollit lift. the manifoldXXXmanyfold hasXXXas burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the bottomXXXbotton of it.

 The Sick Sow.

As I went in the gate the old bull started to turnXXXtern on me, so old man Jones, said get behind that old cart Joe.
About 4 or 5 minutes after, I came out from behind the cart.
They had got the old bull back in the shed.
Then he asked me if I would helpXXXheld him bring daisy the old cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a nothing calf.
So he put herXXXhere in with old Toogey the bull he got on herXXXhere back and we let him stay with herXXXhere forXXXfore about half of an hour.
About four to five month after she had been with the old bull she had a calf it was a bull calf.
When it was about ten weeks old, when we sold it it made #15.10s.6d.
Then the time came for the old bull to be sold he was tooXXXto old and fat for the old cows.
