I am writing a storyXXXsory about what I do in the summer HolidayXXXHolliday when it is hot I go swimming and when it isn'tXXXisten so hot I go to find some wild insectsXXXinsexs last year I had some frogspawnXXXfrogsporn .
I have some everyXXXevry year and only a few dieXXXdiy .
ItXXXI is quite hardXXXhad to find a place for I keep my frog spawnXXXsporn underneathXXXundernethe the tank where I it is very cool it takesXXXthak about 3 monthsXXXmonsth to get hast first they get long then they grow their finsXXXfinse and after a few weeks they get bigger and bigger.
but last year thereXXXtheir wasn'tXXXwhan't very manyXXXmeay eggs around I went to the moat firstXXXfast there weren'tXXXwhernt any there so I went down the lane but nearXXXnere the whiteXXXwithe bridge there was onlyXXXony about 50 eggs.
I got down and pickedXXXpiked them up with my hands and put themXXXthen in a big jarXXXgare with some sea weed they must have a large tin or a largeXXXlarg jarXXXgare not a small thing otherwiseXXXotherwise when the tadpolesXXXtadpolls growXXXgrows they have not muchXXXmush room to move I use a big paint tin to put my frog spawnXXXsporn in and when they get to be frogs and at the end of my garden their is a stream I climbXXXclime down the back and tipXXXtope the frogsXXXrogs in the water and you can justXXXgust watchXXXwash them swim away.
ItXXXI is best to tipXXXtiper the frogsXXXfrog away when they justXXXgust loseXXXloos their tail then you know theyXXXthere will live and just one other thing you must keep them cleanXXXglean andXXXhand theirXXXthere sea weedXXXwead every week and they will like a bit of rough meat to chewXXXchow and that will keep them alive.

I also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown wavyXXXwavey hair not much taller than me.
I want a man that likes children and takes them out, and plays with them.
Then we will all be able to go out and enjoy ourselves.
I shall stop nursing when I get married, after I have had a child, then I may do part-time work.
I want to get married in white.
I want to go abroad for my honeymoon.
For the first summer holiday, I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp.
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram.

 Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands.
So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of it until the film was over.
the best boyfriend I ever had .
hisXXXhe's father was posted .
and so Stephen left.
But we still send letters and postcardsXXXpostcards to each other.
So that we still remember each other .

 One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee, but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened, and told me to take the baby down to the Police station.
So I got ready and set off to the station.
Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the Police.
They said that they would put up notices about the baby.
They let me look after him until someone owned up.
A month later.
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to, if not they would put it in a home.
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few days'XXXday's time the baby was ours and weren'tXXXwere'nt we pleased.
So we all lived happily ever after.
The End.

 IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS.
One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and takingXXXtakeing my friend for a walk.
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day .

 Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the meal .

 they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true .

 Because it'sXXXits night time and dark.
Because the wind is wild.
Because the two waves are a ring.
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks.
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach.
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around.
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and there.

 They ran away to get married In a little country called Lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother, father, maids, and four children, the eldest, was Jenny who was 18 years of age, she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12, Jenny had a boyfriend who livedXXXlive a few yards awayXXXaway from her, his name was Johnny he was 20 years of age.
Jenny and Johnny wanted to get marriedXXXmarreid , they had known each other for 6 years, and were very much in love.
They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a married home.
But theXXXthee only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent, to the marriage.
So the two young children decided to runXXXran away and get married.
So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30.
So one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clockXXXoclock and made their way to the station.
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast.
Soon they were on the train.
Now we needn't worry about anythingXXXanythink my darling, said Johnny.
No we can get a job in London and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said Jenny.
yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to London.
2 months pass They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got married  in a registryXXXregistery office and after theyXXXthe celebratedXXXcelebrate until 12 o'clockXXXoclock that night, then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went and rang on Jenny's doorbell first.
hisXXXhe father came to the door, and took one look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married that'sXXXthats why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office.
so "said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but I do wish you'd told us all because I think you are old enough to be man and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home.
you can live here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad, and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch yourXXXyoure parents Johnny, and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and celebrated.

Dear Les,
I hope you are O.K.
just a few lines to write about our English lesson with Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months.
He has taught us how to write good letters, stories, and poems.
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years.
But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work.
Love and best wishes, Judith

 Sir,
Mr. T. says Mr. Holbrook is tooXXXto soft with us by not teaching us spellings.
I agree with Mr t because you cannotXXXcannot write a good story without knowing how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words difficultXXXdiffercult but people who get under 40 find words very difficultXXXdiffercult .
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school.
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly.
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy .
William Glebe 

 Sir,
Mr T says that Mr. Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and doesn'tXXXdoes'nt teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is absolutelyXXXabsolutly nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from.
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them.
Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we concentrateXXXconsantrate , and listenXXXlistern to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world.
When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the spellings, and punctuationXXXpuntuation .
Yours faithfully Judith 

 When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea you'reXXXyour thinkingXXXtinking of.
Jack O'Malley 

 we have to work hard, and it takesXXXtacks hard work to write theseXXXthoese storiesXXXstory and it very hard when people say he soft on us .
