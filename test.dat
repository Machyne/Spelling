Jane was 8 she was frightened of her mum and dad JoanXXXJone was 5 and Alan 1 1/2 years.
He was tooXXXto young to to understand he was crying all the time nevertheless .

 It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly diediad .
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook.
I still have the photo.
The brook was about 8 feet wide.
The water was about 2 feet deep.
But thereXXXthey was 6 feet off wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in I went.
I slowlyXXXslolly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister stoppedXXXstoped and saved my life she held my head above water untill my sisters got home and told my parents.
then they raced down to the brook dad hadXXXhave a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually heXXXhis got me out and carriedXXXcarred me home.
my clothes had to beXXXme destroyedistrod it took seven bathsXXXbath to get me cleanXXXclearn .

 I'mXXXIm am never allowedXXXalloud to sit up and watch programmesXXXprogrames not suitableXXXsurtebull for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, thereXXXthey was a film on TV unfitt for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and killing, men were being hung and othersXXXother were being shot or stabbedXXXstabed .
men had their heads cut in half .

 My work on a farm I have live on a farm all off my life, I am not boastingXXXbosting but I think I know a fair bit about farming.
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery.
Some people say farming is the lowest paidXXXpayed and hardest working employmentXXXimployment out.
I agree with those people.
but I would rather work for my living, than just sittingXXXsiting in a stuffyXXXstufy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do.
Give me the open air life.
My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I leave school.
I am going to take my apprenticeshipXXXapprentiship course when I leave at easter.
that means that I go to classesXXXclassis onceXXXones a week.
I will learn a lot more about farming and if I pull through the course I will be a usefulXXXusfull chap about the farm.
WhileXXXWill I am taking my course I will be gettinget 17 shillingshilling less than the boy worker that is not taking the course.
But when I am 17 and finished my ApprenticeshipXXXApprentiship I will get 10% more than the average pay off a boy my age.
Many people asked me why I have chosenXXXchoosen farming as my future careerXXXcarrer .
(1) I will be in the open air.
(2) I will be doing a differentXXXdiffrent Job every day (3) I am not interested in anythingXXXenthing else.
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been workingXXXwork on the farm in the holidays.
And I can tell the men I have worked with have been good and givenXXXgive me a few tips.
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I leaveXXXlife school.
So if anybody wantsXXXwant an open air life, choose FARMING

 AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet.
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.
when you go scrumping you have got to be carefull you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples.
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears.
when you go pinching applesXXXapple you do not want to take tooXXXto many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you especiallyXXXaspecally little boys they make too much noise.
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be carefulXXXcarful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump whereverXXXwhereever it stings you.
when you are by yourself and someone comes and you have to climb over the barbedXXXbarb wire and get caught the man will probablyXXXprobally catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you.
some people when theyXXXthe catch you they might hit you and sayXXXsaid he will hit you harder next time he catches you.
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat.
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses.
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard.
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be recognizedXXXreconnised very easy because red shows up very easy.
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.

 The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make another savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze.
he's gone to collect his meal.
He makes a leap.
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal.

 WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about.
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song.
The leaves have gone.
It will not be long before the tree has gone.

 StrandedXXXStranden on a Desert Island
One midsummer's day at 9.30 a.m.
a ship was wrecked by a coralXXXcorral reef so people jumped overboard.
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on.
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore.
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfits .
So one man volunteeredXXXvolonteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room.
ThereXXXTheir were dead bodiesXXXbodys on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreck .
ThereXXXTheir were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island.
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room.
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water.
As he openedXXXopen the store room door the water gushed in very quickly.
So he had to feel for the diving suits.
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5.
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent twoXXXto men to help him.
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on thenXXXthe went down to get some food.
LuckyXXXLuckily enough it was mostly tinnedXXXtin food.
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island.
When looking around the deck they saw a lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in.
They all had one tin of something each.
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough.
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts.
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day.
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested.
There was about 35 on the island but people who usedXXXuse't to get coconuts usuallyXXXusally got lost or got bitten by a snake.
They had shortenedXXXshortend downXXXdone from 35 to 15.
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to.
And they could also catch fish to eat.
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they killedXXXkill animals and drank fresh water from springs.
they found here and there.
they found coconuts while hunting for animals.
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside.
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the groundXXXgound and sticks laide across with grass on top of them.
At night they slept all together under coconut trees.
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning.
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again.
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted.
As soon ass they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office.
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since.
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again.

They had got the old bull back in the shed.
Then he asked me if I would helpXXXheld him bring daisy the old cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a nothing calf.
So he put here in with old Toogey the bull he got on here back and we let him stay with here fore about half of an hour.

JUDITH WARD page 157 

 One day at a cafe door stood a very worried young teenager, his name was Rex  harris, he had black hair, and was very tall, he was lonely, every evening because he didn't have a girl to go out with.
Then he saw his friend in the distance, herXXXhe name was Jean Smith, she was very attractive but she already had a boy so there was no good ever waiting for her, when Jean got to the Cafe door, she was very surprised to find Rex there, and she said my goodness you do look glum today what'sXXXwhats the matter, said Jean.
Well I haven't anything to do of an evening now said Rex", Well never mind, come on into the cafe and have a cup of coffee, all right said Rex, In the Cafe I have a wonderful plan, I have a girl friend, who you could take out for an evening, said Jean well, that's just splendidXXXsplended , Jean you'reXXXyour a doll, "OK, OK, Rex don't go tooXXXto far, I'll tell her to come with me to the Cafe over the road at Eleven o'clockXXXoclock , so tomorrow that you can meet her, said Jean, by the way Jean what'sXXXwhats her name, oh!

 When I leave School
When I leave school I want to be a  children's nurse, I shall most probably got to London to get a really good Job, but I will have to be away from home, but my parents said they don't mind me being away from home, as long as I like the Job, and am very interested in the work, of course I will be able to come home for a few days.
I am going to leave school at 15, at Easter, 1962, and I shall work for two years at least before I think about getting a boy.
I want to get married at 20, so that I will have about three years to get engaged, and to get to know each other.
I wantXXXwand two children, one of each or twins.
I also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown wavyXXXwavey hair not much taller than me.
I want a man that likes children and takes them out, and plays with them.
Then we will all be able to go out and enjoy ourselves.
I shall stop nursing when I get married, after I have had a child, then I may do part-time work.
I want to get married in white.
I want to go abroad for my honeymoon.
For the first summer holiday, I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp.
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram.

 Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands.
So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of it until the film was over.
the best boyfriend I ever had .
hisXXXhe's father was posted .
and so Stephen left.
But we still send letters and postcards to each other.
So that we still remember each other .

 One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee, but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened, and told me to take the baby down to the Police station.
So I got ready and set off to the station.
Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the Police.
They said that they would put up notices about the baby.
They let me look after him until someone owned up.
A month later.
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to, if not they would put it in a home.
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few days'XXXday's time the baby was ours and weren'tXXXwere'nt we pleased.
So we all lived happily ever after.
The End.

 When I am a children's Nurse
When I get the Job of a children's nurse, I shall be very happy I'm sure, There will be lots of other nursesXXXnurse's there to help look after the children we have to put the children to bed, and get them dressed, give them theirXXXthere food, and toys to play.
I like looking after young children, I will be able to get home now and then, and see myXXXmay parents.
If one of the children decide that they want to run away then of course we must go and look for them, and bring them back.

 Tick tock, slowly Tick tock, " That's my daddy'sXXXdadies big clock, And my granny's little clock, goes tick,  tock , tick,  tock , tick tock.

 IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS.
One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and takingXXXtakeing my friend for a walk.
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day .

 Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the meal .

 they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true .

 Because it'sXXXits night time and dark.
Because the wind is wild.
Because the two waves are a ring.
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks.
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach.
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around.
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and there.

They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a married home.
But thee only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent, to the marriage.
So the two young children decided to runXXXran away and get married.
So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30.
So one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clockXXXoclock and made their way to the station.
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast.
Soon they were on the train.
Now we needn't worry about anythingXXXanythink my darling, said Johnny.
No we can get a job in London and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said Jenny.
yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to London.
2 months pass They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got married  in a registryXXXregistery office and after theyXXXthe celebratedXXXcelebrate until 12 o'clockXXXoclock that night, then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went and rang on Jenny's doorbell first.
hisXXXhe father came to the door, and took one look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married that'sXXXthats why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office.
so "said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but I do wish you'd told us all because I think you are old enough to be man and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home.
you can live here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad, and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch youre parents Johnny, and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and celebrated.
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl, and they all lived happily ever after.

Dear Les,
I hope you are O.K.
just a few lines to write about our English lesson with Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months.
He has taught us how to write good letters, stories, and poems.
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years.
But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work.
Love and best wishes, Judith

 Sir,
Mr. T. says Mr. Holbrook is tooXXXto soft with us by not teaching us spellings.
I agree with Mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words difficultXXXdiffercult but people who get under 40 find words very difficultXXXdiffercult .
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school.
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly.
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy .
William Glebe 

 Sir,
Mr T says that Mr. Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and doesn'tXXXdoes'nt teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is absolutelyXXXabsolutly nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from.
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them.
Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we concentrateXXXconsantrate , and listenXXXlistern to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world.
When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the spellings, and punctuationXXXpuntuation .
Yours faithfully Judith 

 When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea you'reXXXyour thinkingXXXtinking of.
Jack O'Malley 

 we have to work hard, and it takesXXXtacks hard work to write theseXXXthoese storiestory and it very hard when people say he soft on us .

 I think Mr T shouldXXXshoold come and see Mr.
