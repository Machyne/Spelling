 It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly diedXXXdiad .
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook.
I still have the photo.
The brook was about 8 feet wide.
The water was about 2 feet deep.

 My work on a farm I have live on a farm all ofXXXoff my life, I am not boastingXXXbosting but I think I know a fair bit about farming.
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery.
Some people say farming is the lowest paidXXXpayed and hardest working employmentXXXimployment out.
I agree with those people.
but I would rather work for my living, than just sittingXXXsiting in a stuffyXXXstufy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do.
Give me the open air life.

Many people asked me why I have chosenXXXchoosen farming as my future careerXXXcarrer .
(1) I will be in the open air.
(2) I will be doing a differentXXXdiffrent Job every day (3) I am not interested in anythingXXXenthing else.
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been workingXXXwork on the farm in the holidays.
